            <p id="headp"><strong>INTERNET</strong></p>
            <p id="conp">The Internet (or internet) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses
                the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of
                networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to
                global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The
                Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext
                documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
            </p>
            <p id="conp">
                The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned
                by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers. The primary
                precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic
                and military networks in the 1970s. The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new
                backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide
                participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks. The
                linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition
                to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional,
                personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network. Although the Internet was widely used by
                academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every
                aspect of modern life.

            <p id="conp">
                The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other
                web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which
                may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.The resources of the Web are
                transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software
                application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server. The
                World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two
                decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.
            </p>
            <p id="conp">
                English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in
                1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN to other
                research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. The World
                Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary tool billions of
                people use to interact on the Internet.

            <p id="conp">
                The Internet is a global network of networks while the Web, also referred formally as World Wide Web
                (www) is a collection of information that is accessed via the Internet. Another way to look at this
                difference is, the Internet is infrastructure while the Web is served on top of that infrastructure.
